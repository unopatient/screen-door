There are a few approaches that I would like to try.

> Keep in mind that I know absolutely nothing about anything regarding the subject of mocap, vtubing, pixel art, rendering etc. I'm going into this blind.

The least work intensive (from a programming and modeling perspective) would be to simply use a vtubing setup and pixelate the 3d character models.

The most work intensive option would be to animate character models by hand and map mocap onto those animations.

> I do think there is an opportunity to go somewhat animatic like here. Sort of like mapping emotions to static images. But ideally we would have something smooth and capable of conveying emotion in as few pixels as possible. Streamers should be lively!

> I do see a chance of pivoting such that I simply choose the most economic means of conveying/communicating emotion. But my objective is also to make streaming the info economic. Thats why I'm swayed by the pixel aesthetic in the first place.
